vppps_buffalo_mk4,SHIP,"Following the same suit of deriving the Buffalo freighter for nefarious military purposes, this variant repurposes the cargo holds for missile storage and an autoforge. This missile destroyer is built solely for the purpose of missile doctrine and nothing else.

The modifications include additional armour plating attached to the original structural steel, insulation to the engines to improve the engines’ durability in combat conditions. Not much else is done to the remainder of the civilian-grade design or subsystems; their off-the-shelf availability makes it cheaper - to convert from existing Buffalo hulls - or to print one from the forge.",,,,,
vppps_orangutan,SHIP,"The brainchild of a dream to combine the Monitor and Brawler-class frigates into a single uniform, the result; a destroyer-sized hull all purpose-built for skirmish and battle.

Orangutan inherits the Monitor-class’ ‘Fortress Shield’ and flux shunt design, incorporated into the Brawler-class’ concept of “there are not enough engines” manoeuvrability and skirmish-focused doctrine. 

The focus came at the price of being an one-trick pony and has limited utility and logistical functions, however. Requiring second-part logistics for operations and travel beyond the range of orbital security.",,,,,
vppps_shamshir,SHIP,"Frontal firepower embodied as a battleship, this design traces to a century in the post-Collapse era. It focuses on ballistic and energy firepower on a dreadnought concept, who incorporates the latest in the legal extent of automation.

Why this standard of ship design exists is a debate between different schools and guards of fleet doctrine officers. The original specification draft describes an union of two doctrines; decisive battle’s capital ship; with superior firepower’s amassed large firepower and pricing crew’s survival with higher regard. Furthermore combine the pinnacles of the lower-end and higher-end of technology in both protection and weaponry into a ‘midline’ platform.

A count, no more than the fingers on a hand, of prototypes were made, but the project failed to appeal anybody for a number of reasons: The inherent cost in manufacturing and technological development. A degree of doctrinal alienation that old guard took offense to. The fury of Tri-Tachyon to the design bureau ‘failing to pay the consultation fees and patent royalties’. 

The prototypes exchanged between different pairs of hands before all recorded specimen were lost to the hardship of Persean Sector. The bureau ceased to exist under suspicious circumstances, the blueprints somewhere out there to be found.",,,,,
vppps_bishop,SHIP,"The prospector unions’ answer to the pirate threat preying on salvage excursions into the lost frontier in the Persean Sector. The smaller salvo ships were consolidated into this larger beast, with a drone small-craft fleet to show.

The Bishop emerged as a post-collapse design with mind to second-hand market of military goods without sacrificing utility functions. Consolidating the smaller frigates into a larger ship whose drone small-craft fleet replaces the frigates, minimizing the surface of vulnerability in the salvager fleet. Although the ship design is an expensive one-time investment, it is more often that salvo collectives, unions, or richer entrepreneurs can afford one Bishop as the jewel of the fleet crown.",,,,,
